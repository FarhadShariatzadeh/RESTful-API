    <p>
        This is a Web Service API to create a League-table with associated information. It is useful when you play 
        any games with your friends and would like to keep tracking of teams' scores and best players.
        The API includes the typical CRUD operations including GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT. There is 2 levels granularity
        for GET and POST methods. Also, overloaded methods have been provided for GET and POST methods.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h2>Overloaded GET Method</h2>
    <p>
        http://localhost:54662/api/team/1 <br />

    <h2>Two-level granularity GET Method</h2>
    <p>

        By sleceting GET method, this URI connects to the two-level granularity GET method which returns a specific information about a specific team.

                write a json-format script in the Body like below to add a new team:
                example -->  { "TeamName" : "Real Sociedad", "TeamPlayed" : "28", "TeamPoints":"33"}
    </p>

                The second granularity level should be "4" as this is assagned to the forth property of a "Team" object which is "topScoredPlayers" list.
